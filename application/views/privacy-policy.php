            <p>247Sue is governed under the Rules and Regulations of General Data Protection Regulation, 2016 for Users
              located in the European Union and other relevant data protection acts in countries where the
              User&rsquo;s are located. GDPR regulates how personal information is handled by 247Sue. We will review
            this policy regularly, and we may update it from time to time.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>'Personal information' means information or an opinion about an identified individual, or
                      an individual who is reasonably identifiable. The Company&rsquo;s Privacy Policy applies
                    to personal information collected and/or held by the Company.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy also explains how we process 'personal data'.</p>

                <h2>TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HELD</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>In order to deliver our goods, services, and customer assistance, we collect personal
                      data from our users. Websites, mobile applications, emails, and telephone calls are just
                      a few of the platforms we use to deliver our goods, provide our services, and assist
                      customers. The particular platform you use and the particular product, service, or
                    support you use may have an impact on the personal data we gather.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>As it does not allow us to identify you as a specific natural person, not all of the
                      information requested, gathered, and processed by us qualifies as "Personal
                      Information." Most "User Created Material" that you send us with the aim of sharing with
                      other users will go under this category. This privacy statement does not apply to any
                      "Non-Personal Information." Non-personal information will be treated as personal
                      information when combined with existing personal information or utilized in aggregate
                      form. As a result, for the interest of transparency, both types of information will be
                    provided in this privacy policy.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Users may occasionally give us personal information without our asking for it or using
                      methods that aren't designed for gathering a certain kind of data. The information given
                      will not be subject to this privacy policy since the user will have circumvented our
                      systems, procedures, and control, even though we may take reasonable precautions to
                    secure this data.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Users may occasionally give us personal information through channels that are not within
                      our control, such social media or forums. While this Privacy Policy governs all
                      information we gather, the platform via which it was shared will have its own Privacy
                    Policy.</p>

                      <li>
                        <p>You might be prompted to provide specific categories of personal information when
                          using our products and services. Our website, applications, chat platforms,
                          telephone, paper forms, and in-person encounters are all possible ways for this
                          to happen. When we ask for your personal information, we will offer you a
                          Collection Notice outlining how we plan to use it. The notice could be spoken or
                        written.</p>

                          including but not limited to Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, and others. This
                          Privacy Statement will apply to all information that is collected. By disabling
                          our access on the other platform or contacting our support staff, users can
                        prevent us from obtaining data from other platforms.</p>

                    <p>You have the right to ask to see any personal data the Company may have on you. Unless an
                      exception occurs, we must give you access to the personal data we have on you within a
                      reasonable amount of time, without undue expense, and without charging you anything. By
                      logging into your account, you can access the majority of your personal information.
                      Please get in touch with our privacy officer if you want to access data that isn't
                      available through the platform or if you want to obtain all the personal data we have on

                  <li>
                    <p>In relation to the personal information the Company holds on you, you also have a number
                      of other rights, however there might be limitations on how you can use them. This is
                      largely because of the characteristics of the goods and services we offer. A large
                      portion of the information we gather is used to support user contracts, process
                      payments, and safeguard the genuine users of our marketplace; these data uses are
                    shielded from the rights listed below.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>You have the right to:</p>

                    <p>Human review of automated decision making and/or profiling - In the case of our ranking
                      algorithms, it is not possible to exercise this right as this ranking is a fundamental
                      part of the marketplace that users participate in, opting out would mean not being able
                      to participate in the marketplace. Decisions affecting marketplace security are already
                    reviewed by humans.</p>

                      are used to support contracts between users, document financial transactions, and are
                      used in protecting other legitimate users of the marketplace. In the case of
                      non-personal data that can be linked with personal data, it will either be erased or
                    otherwise anonymised from the personal data.</p>
