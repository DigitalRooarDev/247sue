                  <li>
                    <p>Any money you've put into your account can be refunded at any time (as defined in the
                      terms and conditions of the website agreement) or it's money you owe us for fees or
                    other charges.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>If the amount the Client has asked to refund relates to our fees and charges, the process
                    set out in the Clause "Disputes with Us" must be followed.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>The same payment method(s) that the Client used to pay us initially will be used to

                  <li>
                    <p>We may refund funds to Clients irrespective of whether a Client has requested funds be

                      <li>
                        <p>we are required by law or consider that we are required by law to do so;</p>

                      <li>
                        <p>we determine that refunding funds to the Client will avoid any dispute or an
                        increase in our costs;</p>

                      <li>
                        <p>we refund funds to the Client in accordance with any refund policy specified by
                        us from time to time;</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>we find out that the original payment made by the Client is fraudulent;</p>

                      <li>
                        <p>the Client made a duplicate payment in error; or</p>

                      <li>
                        <p>we consider, in our sole opinion, that it is likely that the refund of funds is
                        necessary to avoid a credit card chargeback.</p>

                      or financial institutions, and any following reversal instructions. We do not make
                    chargebacks. We are required to comply with such directives.</p>

                    <p>For any claim, the Corporation may choose to use binding, non-appearance-based
                      arbitration to settle the conflict in an affordable way. You must choose an established
                      alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider from a list of ADR providers that the
                      Company will offer you if it decides to use arbitration. If the Company chooses
                      arbitration, the arbitration will be conducted through one of these ADR providers. The
                    following guidelines must be followed by both the parties and the ADR provider:</p>

                        <p>the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on
                          written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating
                        the arbitration;</p>

                      <li>
                        <p>the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or
                        witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and</p>

                      <li>
